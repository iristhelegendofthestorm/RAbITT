# RAbITT
A tool to do the grunt work of translating Roblox studio projects to Unity.
Roblox Abandonment Internal Translator Tool

This tool for now is an open source proof of conecpt, hopefully to be used as a practical tool in the future.

RAbITT does the grunt work of porting existing physics, logic, and others from Roblox studio into Unity.  Playercontrollers, models, and animations will most likely still have to be set up, and alternatives for chat, transactions, and netowrking.

This tool will not be an end all be all, but it is a tool to help devs move to a less predatory gaming ecosystyem using tools they are already familiar with.
Passionate devs deserve to move from the archaic Roblox engine to something newer and more flexible like Unity, make money from Steam players, and move away from the unsafe Roblox platform.

Consider joining the discord or supporting my Patreon/Kofi.  Your money will go to hiring devs to help on the project, and your support will be greatly appreciated.
